# email-alert-api

Sends emails to users that subscribe to specific GOV.UK email alerts.

Provides a consistent internal interface to external email
notification services. Currently supports only [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/).

Given a tagged publication event, it sends email alerts for
subscribers to those tags via the external services.
